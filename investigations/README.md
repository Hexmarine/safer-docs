# Investigations index

Dated discovery notes for the SensorGlobal → Safer Homes platform handover:
architecture mapping, cost/security analysis, incident root-causes, and migration
planning. Each file is a **point-in-time record** — kept as history even once the
finding is acted on. Newer notes supersede older ones on the same topic; the
**Latest / authoritative** column below points to the one to read first.

Stable, continuously-current knowledge lives in [`../infra/`](../infra/) (topic
docs) and [`../runbooks/`](../runbooks/) (executable procedures); investigation
notes link out to those when a finding has graduated into one.

Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic.md`.
